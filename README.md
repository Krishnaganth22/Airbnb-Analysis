Data Cleaning Process for Airbnb Dataset
This README file outlines the steps involved in the data cleaning process for the Airbnb dataset. The goal of data cleaning is to ensure the dataset is accurate, complete, and ready for analysis and visualization.

Steps Involved in Data Cleaning
Loading the Data:

Import the necessary libraries.
Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
python
Copy code
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('airbnb.csv')
Handling Missing Values:

Identify missing values in the dataset.
Decide on a strategy to handle missing values (e.g., removing rows, filling with mean/median/mode, etc.).

Removing Duplicates:

Check for and remove duplicate rows to ensure the dataset contains unique records.

Data Type Conversion:

Ensure that each column has the correct data type (e.g., integers, floats, strings, dates).

Handling Outliers:

Identify and handle outliers in the dataset to improve the quality of analysis.

Standardizing Text Data:

Ensure consistency in text data by standardizing the format (e.g., converting to lowercase, removing special characters).

Creating New Columns:

Derive new columns from existing ones if necessary for the analysis.

Renaming Columns:

Rename columns to more meaningful names if necessary.

Dropping Unnecessary Columns:

Remove columns that are not needed for the analysis to reduce complexity.

Final Check:

Perform a final check to ensure the dataset is clean and ready for analysis.
python
Copy code
# Checking the cleaned dataset
print(df.info())
print(df.describe())
Conclusion
The data cleaning process is a crucial step in preparing the dataset for analysis. By following the steps outlined above, we can ensure the dataset is accurate, complete, and ready for visualization and further analysis.

# EDA AND DATA VISUALIZATION USING PLOTLY SEABORN AND MATPLOTLIB And Developing Streamlit app


Airbnb Data Visualization and Price Analysis
This project provides an interactive web application for visualizing and analyzing Airbnb data. It uses Python, Pandas, and Streamlit to create dynamic plots and gain insights into pricing variations, availability patterns, and location-based trends.

Features
Home Page: Provides an overview of the project and its purpose.
Overview Page: Contains interesting reports and visualizations:
Pie chart showing reviews by cancellation policy.
Bar chart showing price distribution by property type.
Top 10 hosts with the highest cleaning fees, along with their country and amenities.
Management Page: Allows users to filter data based on country, property type, room type, and price:
Top 10 property types by total listings.
Top 10 hosts with the highest number of listings.
Pie chart showing total listings in each room type.
Choropleth map showing total listings in each country.
Explore Page: Provides further analysis and visualizations:
Average price in each room type.
Box plot showing availability by room type.
Scatter geo plot showing average price in each country.
Scatter geo plot showing average availability in each country.
Installation
Clone the repository:

sh
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/airbnb-visualization.git
cd airbnb-visualization
Install the required dependencies:

sh
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Set up the MySQL database and create a database named airbnb. Import your dataset into a table named airbnb1.

Configure the database connection in the script.

Usage
Run the Streamlit application:

sh
Copy code
streamlit run airbnb.py
